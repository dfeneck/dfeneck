## ✨ Projects
### ![The Motherland](http://themotherland.ddns.net:8317/)
I run and maintain a small Australian Minecraft server. Come play with us.

### ![Gemstones Canberra](http://feneck.net:8317/gems/)
I created and maintain a local gemstones web store. The design is exactly as requested by the client, not mine.

### 3Fault
I operate a small games company. We are currently working on something new that we're not ready to show off yet.
